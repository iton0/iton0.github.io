From the world of exercise and sports science to the dynamic realm of technology, I've always been driven by a passion for problem-solving. My journey began with a focus on human movement and performance, but I discovered that the same analytical and strategic thinking I used in that field could be applied to building something new and impactful.

This realization led me to pursue an A.A.S. in Computer Programming, where I quickly fell in love with crafting software and developing practical applications. I've channeled this passion into personal projects like HkUp and FolderForge, which have given me hands-on experience in building useful tools from the ground up. I also believe in the power of collaboration and have actively contributed to open-source projects, which has taught me to work with others and build solutions for a wider community.

I have a solid foundation in Go, Python, and Java, and I am eager to apply my skills to a challenging entry-level software development role. I'm excited to continue to grow as a developer and contribute to innovative solutions within a professional team.
